msgid ""
"That might explain it. The demons are well-aware how evil they are. They are "

msgid ""
"Well, that's one orc fortress down. ...I guess we will just have to move on "

msgstr ""
"好的，现在已经有一个兽人要塞倒下了。我猜现在我们必须寻找下一个了。当我们离开"

msgid ""
"Well, this country looks much more corrupted by them than our land, so it is "
