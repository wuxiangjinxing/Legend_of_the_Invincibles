In her half-ethereal presence that she entered in order to escape, she was unable to wave wings fast enough to stop the fall."

That is possible, I dare even to say that it is probable, but I have a feeling this is not over.

Seeing her fall from the tower must have shattered the faith of the spirits around, and maybe of all spirits in this world, news travel fast, but the spirits within her will not know about this defeat. And I am afraid that only a small part of the spirits that were within her wanders this land."

You might be right, a person of her power would have kept more bodies to switch them. I mean... preserved corpses. She was not much weakened by this. Her army's faith weakened greatly for sure, but if we meet her again, she will probably be much stronger, she will not be just awakened from sleep."

Yes, but if we create a portal from their world here, and then from here into the world of the dead, place them one next to another, and use an enchantment that pulls everything from the first portal into the second portal, it might actually get rid of them without having to fight them. In the world of the dead, everybody loses his faith quickly. But we will have to weaken her severely first, or she will try to stop it and bad things will happen.

Remember that name. In that building, there were several judges. They checked me if they could accelerate the forgetting. They said that those who lose all memories are reborn, and that the thing they were trying was an experimental process, unnatural and not perfectly responsible. I passed the check, and they started the process of accelerating the forgetting. First, lots of memories were flowing through my mind.
